            <h2 class="light">The internet can be used for many useful things, but can also be used in very toxic ways.</h2>
            <h2 class="light">Firstly, the web can be almost completely anonymous, so people feel more comfortable doing things that are socially unacceptable, for example; some people raid public services for the joy, some even make offensive jokes about tragedies. Now this might be a little off-topic, but people will go as far as stalking, even <strong>murder</strong> <sup>(See example 1)</sup> for others to watch. Some people leak personnel information just because they can. <sup>(See example 2)</sup>

            <div style="margin: 7px;">Examples;</div><ul style="margin: 0; list-style-type: decimal">
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web">The wiki for the <strong>Dark Web</strong></a></li>
        <li><a href="https://v3rmillion.net/">v3rmillion</a> (A hacking forum)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.4chan.org/">4chan</a> (if you browse long enough, you'll see what I mean)</li>
            </ul>
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h2 class="light">Secondly, you're connected to literally everyone with a computer, so you're bound to run into people you'll really wanna argue with.
                Everyone has a different mindset, some will harass you until they are classified <q>right</q>, and then people try to stop that person, leading to chaos. (Trust me, I've seen it happen)
                Some people will oppress others to be #1, and will even target <i>less-intelligent</i>. There are a lot of people online who will discriminate others for satisfaction, and in some cases, harass someone until they fear ever going outside.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h2 class="light">Overall, the internet has a lot of toxic people lurking, giving false information and harassing others. A good way to avoid these kind of people are;            <ul style="margin: 0;">
                <li>Take breaks from time to time</li>
                <li>Don't talk to strangers online</li>
                <li>Don't go on public chats</li>
                </ul></h2>
